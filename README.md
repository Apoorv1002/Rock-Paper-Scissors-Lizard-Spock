A game of chance that expands the traditional game of Rock, Paper Scissors. 
In the words of inventor Sam Kass himself - when you know someone well enough, 75-80% of any Rock-Paper-Scissors games you play with that person end up in a tie. This game is a slight variation to the original model that reduces the tie probability. 
The rules of the game were mentioned, a python list was used to indicate possible choices, user choice was input and automated random system generated choice was compared with user choice using pythonâ€™s inbuilt conditional statements if, elif and else.
